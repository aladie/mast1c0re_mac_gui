# Mast1c0re Mac Gui
Rewrote @McCaulay's mast1c0re file loader with tkinter instead of wxPython and precompiled a version for MacOs

The only thing missing from this version is a progress bar while uploading the file to the console.
I figured it would not be necessary because the progress can be observed on the console itself.

However with a bit more work, it sure can be implemented.

All credit for mas1c0re go to @McCaulay and @CTurt.
