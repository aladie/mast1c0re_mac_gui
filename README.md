# Mast1c0re Mac Gui
Rewrote @McCaulay's mast1c0re file loader with tkinter instead of wxPython and precompiled a version for MacOs

The only thing missing from this version is a progress bar while uploading the file to the console.
I figured it would not be necessary because the progress can be observed on the console itself.

However with a bit more work, it sure can be implemented.

All credit for mas1c0re go to @McCaulay and @CTurt.

# Troubleshooting
~~If you get a launch error, please check your Python installation.~~

~~Note:~~
~~This programm needs at least Python3.11 to work flawlessly.~~

~~You can donwnload the version of Python I used here:~~
~~https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/python-3.11.2-macos11.pkg~~

_This is fixed as of release 0.0.2_
